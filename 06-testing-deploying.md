# Testing and Deploying

## Testing endpoints

You can implement `POSTMAN` or `CURL` for these operations.
Make simple `HTTP` request to the server's url and check the response.

- GET `/books`

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/books
```

- GET `/books/:id`

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/books/{id}
```
